## Learning objectives

In today's lab you will...

1.  Use **mathematical models** to **test hypotheses**
2.  Use **mathematical models** to **construct confidence intervals**
3.  **Compare** mathematical and randomization approaches to inference

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_classic(14))
set.seed(123)

```

## Mathematical models

This lab will repeat the inferences you conducted in last week's lab, using mathematical models instead of randomization. Let's recall our data from last week. You'll need to copy the data file to your `week5/data` directory.

```{r}
#| label: fig-eelgrass-data
#| fig-cap: "Success of eelgrass restoration plots by restoration method."

restoration <- read_csv("week5/data/eelgrass.csv",
                        show_col_types = FALSE)
ggplot(restoration, aes(treatment, fill = success_fct)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("firebrick", "cornflowerblue")) +
  labs(x = "Restoration method",
       y = "Sites",
       fill = "Outcome") +
  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(1, 1),
        legend.justification = c(1, 1))

```

### Hypothesis test

Once again, we want to know if the popsicle stick method works better for restoration than garden staples. This is a *"yes/no?"* question, so we're conducting a hypothesis test. Instead of using permutation to estimate our sampling distribution, we will assume the sampling distribution is normally distributed. Under the *null hypothesis* (i.e., no difference in proportions), we make this assumption:

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1} &\sim Normal(0, SE(\hat{p})) \\
\hat{p} &= \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2} \\
SE(\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1}) &= \sqrt{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p}) (\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})} \\
\end{align}
$$

::: callout-note
This math describes the assumptions of the null hypothesis for a difference in proportions. The key points are:

1.  The distribution of the statistic ($\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1}$) follows a normal distribution (i.e., the shape of the sampling distribution).
2.  We assume the mean of the sampling distribution is 0, because this is the **null hypothesis**.
3.  The standard error of the sampling distribution is based on the POOLED proportion because we're assuming *no difference between the proportions*.
:::

This is how you would have tested your hypothesis using permutation:

1.  Identify the STATISTIC
2.  State your NULL and ALTERNATIVE hypotheses
3.  Calculate the OBSERVED statistic
4.  Estimate the NULL DISTRIBUTION
5.  Calculate P-VALUE
6.  Compare p-value to CRITICAL THRESHOLD

Using a mathematical model, you modify step 4. Instead of using randomization to estimate the null distribution, you use a normal variable. The following questions walk you through the steps. Note: many of these steps are *exactly the same* as last week's lab.

#### Identify the statistic

**Q1: What is the appropriate statistic for this question?**

Difference of proportions

#### State your null and alternative hypotheses

**Q2: What are your null and alternative hypotheses?**

H0: Using a popsicle stick makes no difference in restoration (failure or success) compared to garden staples.

HA: The popsicle stick method works better for restoration than garden staples.

#### Calculate the sample statistic

**Q3: How would you calculate the statistic *for the sample*?**

Call the variable `diff_props`.

```{r}
#| label: q3
#| eval: false

success_props <- restoration %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarize(prop_success = sum(success)/n())

diff_props <- success_props$prop_success[2] - success_props$prop_success[1]

diff_props

```

#### Estimate the null distribution

**Q4: What's the standard error of the sample's statistic?**

```{r}
#| label: q4
#| eval: false

# p_hat is the POOLED proportion, i.e. the overall proportion of success
p_hat <- sum(restoration$success) / nrow(restoration)

# n's are the number of observations in each treatment
# n1: number of garden staple observations
# n2: number of popsicle stick observations
n1 <- sum(restoration$treatment == "Garden staple")
n2 <- sum(restoration$treatment == "Popsicle stick")


se_p_hat <- sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) * (1 / n1  + 1 / n2))

```

If you calculated `se_p_hat` correctly, the following figure should depict the PDF of the null distribution. It should be a normal variable with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to the standard error of $\hat p$.

```{r}
#| label: fig-null-distribution
#| eval: false

null_dist <- tibble(
  diff_prop = seq(-0.4, 0.4, length.out = 1000),
  density = dnorm(diff_prop, mean = 0, sd = se_p_hat)
)
 
ggplot(null_dist, aes(diff_prop, density)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue", linewidth = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_props, color = "firebrick", linewidth = 2)

```

#### Calculate the p-value

Use the `pnorm()` function to get the area under the curve of a normal distribution.

::: callout-tip
By default, `pnorm()` will tell you the area under the curve *to the left* of a value. Since we want the area *to the right* of the observed statistic, set `lower.tail` to `FALSE`.
:::

**Q5: Fill in the blanks to calculate the p-value**

```{r}
#| label: q5
#| eval: false

p_val <- pnorm(diff_props, mean = 0, sd = se_p_hat, lower.tail = FALSE) # first argument is sample stat
p_val

```

#### Compare p-value to critical threshold

**Q6: How does your p-value compare to a critical threshold** $\alpha=0.05$**? How would you interpret that?**

My p-value is 0.08, which is higher than the critical threshold. This suggests that we would fail to reject the null hypothesis that popsicle sticks lead to more success as a restoration method than garden staples.

### Confidence interval

Now we want to estimate how differently the popsicle stick and garden staple methods perform. This is a *"how much?"* question, so we're constructing a confidence interval. Instead of using bootstrapping to estimate our sampling distribution, we will assume the sampling distribution is normally distributed. We make this assumption:

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1} &\sim Normal(p_2 - p_1, SE(\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1})) \\
SE(\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1}) &= \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1 - \hat{p_1})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p_2}(1 - \hat{p_2})}{n_2}} \\
\end{align}
$$

::: callout-note
This math describes the assumptions of constructing a confidence interval for a difference in proportions. The key points are:

1.  The distribution of the statistic ($\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1}$) follows a normal distribution (i.e., the shape of the sampling distribution).
2.  We assume the mean of the sampling distribution is the population parameter ($p_2 - p_1$).
3.  The standard error of the sampling distribution is based on the two samples' proportions, rather than pooling them, because we're assuming *there's a difference between the proportions*.
:::

This is how you would have built a confidence interval using bootstrapping:

1.  Identify the STATISTIC
2.  Substitute sample for population and draw BOOTSTRAP SAMPLES
3.  Estimate the BOOTSTRAP DISTRIBUTION of the statistic
4.  Construct the CONFIDENCE INTERVAL

Using a mathematical model changes how steps 2 and 3 work, with the same goal of estimating the sampling distribution. Instead of using randomization to draw bootstrap samples, you use a normal variable. The procedure works like this:

1.  Identify the STATISTIC
2.  Calculate the STANDARD ERROR of the statistic
3.  Construct the CONFIDENCE INTERVAL using a normal variable

The following questions walk you through the steps.

#### Identify the statistic

**Q7: What is the appropriate test statistic for this question?**

Difference of propostions

#### Calculate the standard error

**Q8: Fill in the blanks below to calculate the standard error of the statistic**

::: callout-note
Remember that the standard error is going to differ between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Hypothesis testing begins by assuming the *null hypothesis* is true, so the standard error describes a scenario where there are no differences ($p_2=p_1$). Confidence intervals assume the difference is real, so the standard error comes from a different scenario ($p_2 > p_1$). Hence the difference in equations.
:::

```{r}
#| label: q8
#| eval: false

# Calculate the proportions of the two treatments
# Let treatment 1 be "Garden staple"
p_hat1 <- mean(restoration$success[restoration$treatment == "Garden staple"])
# Let treatment 2 be "Popsicle stick"
p_hat2 <- mean(restoration$success[restoration$treatment == "Popsicle stick"])

# n1 and n2 remain the same from before

# Calculate standard error
se_diff_props <- sqrt((p_hat1 * (1- p_hat1) / n1) + (p_hat2 * (1- p_hat2) / n2))
se_diff_props

```

If you calculated `se_diff_props` correctly, the following figure should depict the PDF of the sampling distribution. It should be a normal variable with mean equal to the observed statistic in the sample and standard deviation equal to the standard error.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ci-sampling-distribution
#| eval: false

sampling_dist <- tibble(
  diff_prop = seq(-0.2, 0.5, length.out = 1000),
  density = dnorm(diff_prop, mean = diff_props, sd = se_diff_props)
)
 
ggplot(sampling_dist, aes(diff_prop, density)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue", linewidth = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = diff_props, color = "firebrick", linewidth = 2)

```

#### Construct the confidence interval

Using bootstrapping, you constructed the confidence interval using the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the bootstrapped sampling distribution. Using the mathematical model, you use the function `qnorm()`. Whereas `pnorm()` returns the area under the curve, `qnorm()` tells you what value corresponds to a given area. In other words, they're inverses of each other.

If you wanted to shade in the middle 95% of the area in the figure above, `qnorm()` would tell you the left and right boundaries.

**Q9: Fill in the blanks to use** `qnorm()` **in constructing the confidence interval.**

```{r}
#| label: q9
#| eval: false

diff_props_ci <- qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), mean = diff_props, sd = se_diff_props)
diff_props_ci

```

**Q10: How would you interpret this confidence interval**

We are 95% confident that the true difference in proportions falls between -0.06 and 0.34.

## Comparing mathematical and randomization approaches

**Q11: What are permutation tests and mathematical models [both]{.underline} trying to estimate for hypothesis tests?**

Both are testing how likely it is that our sample statistic could occur by chance if our null hypothesis is true.

*The sampling distribution of the statistic assuming the null hypothesis is true.*

**Q12: What are bootstrapping and mathematical models [both]{.underline} trying to estimate for confidence intervals?**

Both are trying to find a range within we are 95% confident that our sample statistic can be found within.

*The sampling distribution of the statistic assuming the difference is real.*

**Q13: What area under the curve is relevant to hypothesis tests? What R function calculates it for a mathematical model?**

The area under the curve to the right of our test statistic (null distribution -- centered at 0). The R function for this is pnorm().

*The area of the null distribution more extreme than the observed value. pnorm()*

**Q14: What area under the curve is relevant to confidence intervals? What R function calculates it for a mathematical model?**

The are under the curve between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. The R function for this is qnorm().

*The middle 95% of the area under the sampling distribution. qnorm()*

## Go further

The `restoration` data frame contains data about the eelgrass shoot density of the plot post-restoration (`shoot_density_m2`). Use this data to do the following.

1.  Construct the 95% CI of mean shoot density following restoration (ignoring the restoration method). Use a mathematical model. Recall the standard error of a mean is:

$$
SE(\bar x) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

```{r}
sample_mean <- mean(restoration$shoot_density_m2)
se_xbar <- (sd(restoration$shoot_density_m2)/sqrt(nrow(restoration)))

qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), mean = sample_mean, sd = se_xbar)
```

2.  Estimate the p-value of the difference in mean shoot density between the two restoration methods. Use a mathematical model. Recall the standard error of a difference in means, under the null hypothesis, is:

$$
SE(\bar{x_2}-\bar{x_1}) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

3.  Repeat constructing the 95% CI of mean shoot density following restoration, but use bootstrapping instead of a mathematical model.
4.  Repeat estimating the p-value of the difference in mean shoot density between the two restoration methods, but use a permutation test instead of a mathematical model.
